## Get request: percent fee rebate when trading with a code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/code-rebate?code=DOUBLE_AG

Response:
`{"type":"code-rebate", "data":{"rebate_percent": 0.01}}`

The rebate is in percent, that is, 0.01 corresponds to 0.01% of the broker-fees
that will be rebated to traders that use this code

## Get request: percent fee passed-on to agency or referrer

http://127.0.0.1:8000/refer-cut?addr=0x0ab6527027ecff1144dec3d78154fce309ac838c

A referrer without agency will have a fee rebate that is determined by their token
holdings.

`{"type":"refer-cut", "data":{"passed_on_percent": 25.1}}`
The rebate is in percent, that is, 25.1 corresponds to 25.1% of the broker-fees
that were earned with all downstream referrals (downstream from the given address)  
are passed to the given agency/referral. Example: if the agency has 2 codes
further down the chain with 3 traders and they pay 450 MATIC in fees over a period,
this agency will receive 450 MATIC*25.1% and can pass on a share of it downstream.
What the agency actually earns then depends on how much is passed on downstream and
how much volume will be generated by the different codes downstream. 

## Get request: historical earnings

## referral-volume
Calculate the total referred volume

old:
 // 1) identify codes for the referrer
 // 2) for each code look-up code usage for (trader, from, to)
 // 3) query trading volume (trader, from, to) from API for each record found in 2
 // 4) aggregate
new:
1) identify all agencies/referrers in the referral_chain that are a child of the given agency
2) identify all codes that are issued by these addresses
3) continue as the old query

## ok: open-trader-rebate


## ok: agency-rebate
Now same as referral-rebate

## ok: referral-rebate
Queries how much rebate the referrer gets for the given token holding amount or with their agency
-> referral not in referral_chain, based on token holdings
-> referral as child in token_chain, find queue

## ok: my-referral-codes

## done: select-referral-code

## done: refer
as agency or broker (child in referral-chain or broker) we can add a new child.
the child (refer to address) is not allowed to be already in the quueue
This needs to be signed by the agency/broker and we need to check the signature
-Edit?

- done: upsert-referral-code
Anyone can create a code. The parent is either a child in the referral_chain, or
the broker
